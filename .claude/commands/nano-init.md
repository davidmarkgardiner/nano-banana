Setup initial node.js project this will be have prompt box that will be sent to nano banano api and return an image to be diplsayed on the webpage
dont worry about the nano api connection for now lets just get structure in place.

the idea being I can have nano banano inject images into my web apps to keep it looking fresh and fun the images will be based aroudn the webite service like, coffee, yoga, jewlerly etc
