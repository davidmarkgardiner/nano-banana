```

### State Management
- Use React Context or Zustand for checkout state
- Persist checkout data in localStorage for recovery
- Clear sensitive data after completion

### API Endpoints
- POST /api/stripe/create-payment-intent - Create Stripe payment intent
- POST /api/orders/create - Create order in Supabase
- POST /api/orders/confirm - Confirm order after payment
- GET /api/shipping/calculate - Calculate shipping costs

### Database Schema
- orders table with customer, shipping, billing, items
- order_items table with product details and quantities
- shipping_methods table with rates and regions
- promo_codes table with discounts

## Design Requirements

### Claymorphism Theme
- Soft elevated cards with rounded corners (radius-lg)
- Organic progress indicators with smooth transitions
- Inset form fields with subtle shadows
- Floating order summary with glass effect
- Smooth color transitions on interactions

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px (single column)

- Desktop: > 1024px (full sidebar layout)

## Security Considerations
- PCI compliance via Stripe hosted fields
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure session handling
- HTTPS only for production

## Performance Targets
- Page load < 2 seconds
- Step transitions < 300ms
- Payment processing < 5 seconds
- Form validation < 100ms response

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Clear error announcements
- Focus management between steps

## Success Metrics
- Checkout conversion rate > 70%
- Cart abandonment rate < 30%
- Average checkout time < 3 minutes
