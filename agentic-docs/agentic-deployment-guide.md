## Planning Stage

### Initial Assessment
- **Define Project Scope**: Clearly articulate the application/website requirements, target audience, and success metrics
- **Choose Technology Stack**: Select AI-friendly languages and frameworks (Go, Python, React preferred for agent compatibility)
- **Set Architecture Goals**: Define scalability, security, and performance requirements
- **Establish Quality Standards**: Define coding standards, test coverage requirements, and documentation expectations

### Environment Preparation
- **Repository Setup**: Create main repository with clear structure and CLAUDE.md configuration file
- **Development Environment**: Set up centralized logging, clear error messaging, and rapid feedback loops
- **Tool Integration**: Configure Claude Code with necessary MCP servers and permissions
- **Security Configuration**: Establish access controls, secrets management, and compliance requirements

### Agent Role Definition
Define specific roles for multi-agent workflow:
- **Architect Agent**: System design, architectural decisions, technical planning
- **Builder Agent**: Core implementation, feature development, coding tasks
- **Validator Agent**: Testing, quality assurance, debugging, security checks
- **Scribe Agent**: Documentation, code comments, user guides, technical writing

---

## Tool Selection & Configuration

### Core Tools

- **MCP Servers**: 
  - Playwright MCP for testing automation
  - GitHub MCP for repository management
  - Conductor MCP for workflow orchestration

   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/playwright
   ```
2. **GitHub MCP**: Configure with repository access tokens
3. **Custom MCPs**: Develop project-specific servers as needed

---

## Task Breakdown & Agent Assignment

### Project Decomposition Strategy
1. **Feature-Based Breakdown**: Divide into discrete, testable features
2. **Layer-Based Separation**: Frontend, backend, database, infrastructure
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task dependencies and critical path
4. **Complexity Assessment**: Assign difficulty levels for appropriate agent assignment

### Task Assignment Matrix
| Task Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Tools Required |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| System Architecture | Architect | Scribe | Design tools, documentation |
| API Development | Builder | Validator | IDE, testing frameworks |
| Frontend Components | Builder | Architect | UI frameworks, design system |
| Database Schema | Architect | Builder | Database tools, migration scripts |
| Testing Suite | Validator | Builder | Testing frameworks, coverage tools |
| Documentation | Scribe | All agents | Documentation generators |
| Security Implementation | Validator | Architect | Security scanners, compliance tools |
| Performance Optimization | Builder | Validator | Profiling tools, monitoring |

### Agent Communication Protocol
- **Shared Planning Document**: `/coordination/MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md`
- **Task Registry**: `/coordination/active_work_registry.json`
- **Communication Log**: `/coordination/agent_messages.md`
- **Resource Locks**: `/coordination/agent_locks/`

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Conductor Pattern Implementation
Use Git worktrees for parallel development:
```bash
# Create separate worktrees for each agent
git worktree add ../project-architect architect-branch
git worktree add ../project-builder builder-branch
git worktree add ../project-validator validator-branch
git worktree add ../project-scribe scribe-branch
```

### Agent Launch Commands
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Architect
cd project-architect
claude "You are Agent 1 - Architect. Review MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md and begin system design."

# Terminal 2 - Builder  
cd project-builder
claude "You are Agent 2 - Builder. Review MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md and implement features."

# Terminal 3 - Validator
cd project-validator
claude "You are Agent 3 - Validator. Review MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md and create tests."

# Terminal 4 - Scribe
cd project-scribe
claude "You are Agent 4 - Scribe. Review MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md and update documentation."
```

### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Lock Files**: Prevent resource conflicts during parallel work
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates to shared planning document
- **Conflict Resolution**: Architect agent serves as final decision maker
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into agent activities

## Code Review & Feedback

### AI-Powered Review Process
1. **Automated Quality Gates**: 
   - Code style validation
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Performance analysis
   - Test coverage verification

2. **Multi-Agent Review**:
   - Builder creates pull request
   - Validator reviews for quality and testing
   - Architect reviews for architectural compliance
   - Scribe ensures documentation completeness

### Review Automation Tools
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AI Code Review
        uses: your-org/ai-review-action@v1
        with:
          review-focus: "security,performance,style"
          auto-approve: false
```

### Review Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to style guides and best practices
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and secure coding practices
- **Performance**: Code efficiency and optimization opportunities
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage and quality
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and updated documentation

## Testing Automation

### Playwright Integration
```javascript
// MCP Playwright Configuration
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test.describe('AI-Generated Tests', () => {
  test('user authentication flow', async ({ page }) => {
    // AI agent generates test steps based on requirements
    await page.goto('/login');
    await page.fill('[data-testid=username]', 'testuser');
    await page.fill('[data-testid=password]', 'password');
    await page.click('[data-testid=submit]');
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
  });
});
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation
2. **Integration Tests**: API and service interaction testing
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

### Automated Test Generation
- Use Playwright MCP to record user interactions
- AI agents generate test cases from requirements
- Continuous test maintenance and updates
- Test data management and cleanup
