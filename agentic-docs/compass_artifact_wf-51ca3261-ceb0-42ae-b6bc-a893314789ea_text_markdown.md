# The BMAD Method for AI coding workflows

BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) transforms chaotic AI-assisted development into a systematic process where specialized AI agents collaborate like a real engineering team. The methodology solves context loss between agents through two distinct phases: agentic planning in web interfaces for comprehensive thinking, followed by context-engineered development in IDEs with sharded, self-contained story files. This structured approach enables **60-80% reduction in development time** while maintaining code quality through multi-agent review processes.

## What BMAD stands for and its core philosophy

The Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development operates on three foundational principles that distinguish it from traditional AI coding approaches. First, **agent specialization** mirrors real development teams, with each agent maintaining specific expertise and clean context windows for predictable outputs. Second, the methodology prioritizes **context engineering over prompt engineering**, recognizing that context management is fundamentally a workflow problem rather than a tool limitation. Third, **document-driven development** ensures every decision becomes a living artifact that guides future work and creates institutional knowledge.

The methodology's power emerges from its two-phase structure. During Phase 1 (Planning), teams leverage large context models in web interfaces for comprehensive analysis, using multiple specialized agents to generate complete specifications that serve as the foundation for all subsequent work. Phase 2 (Development) then shards these large documents into manageable pieces, enabling focused development cycles with clean context where agents work sequentially on one story at a time with real-time file operations.

This separation recognizes a critical insight: planning requires broad thinking and multiple perspectives, while coding demands focused execution with minimal context switching. By matching the right tools to each phase, BMAD achieves both comprehensive planning and efficient implementation without the typical trade-offs of AI-assisted development.

## How BMAD structures planning through deployment

The planning phase employs four specialized agents working in sequence to transform ideas into actionable specifications. The **Analyst Agent (Mary)** initiates discovery through market research and strategic analysis, conducting brainstorming sessions that explore edge cases and success metrics while creating the foundational project-brief.md. The **Product Manager Agent (John)** then transforms this brief into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document containing functional requirements, non-functional requirements, epics with user stories, and detailed acceptance criteria in Gherkin format.

Following requirements definition, the **Architect Agent** designs the technical solution using the PRD as input, defining the technology stack, system architecture, API contracts, and coding standards while ensuring alignment with established patterns. For projects with significant UI components, an optional **UX Expert Agent** creates interface specifications and front-end architecture guidelines that complement the technical design.

The development phase introduces a sophisticated orchestration system where the **Product Owner Agent** first shards large planning documents into self-contained development stories. Each story contains complete architectural context, implementation details, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements - eliminating the context loss that plagues typical AI development. The **Scrum Master Agent** then prepares these stories by reviewing previous development notes, drafting detailed implementation plans, and ensuring each unit of work remains manageable at roughly one developer-day of effort.

The **Developer Agent (James)** executes tasks sequentially based on these detailed story files, implementing code and tests with full context while maintaining coding standards and running all validations. Upon completion, the **QA Agent (Quinn)** performs comprehensive reviews that go beyond simple code checking to include risk assessment, test design, requirements tracing, and non-functional requirement validation. This multi-layered approach ensures quality gates at every stage, with clear pass/fail criteria and detailed feedback for continuous improvement.

## Step-by-step implementation checklist

### Environment Setup and Prerequisites

Begin by ensuring Node.js v20+ is installed on your system, along with VS Code or Cursor IDE and access to an LLM API like Claude or GPT-4. Create your project directory and install the BMAD framework using `npx bmad-method install` or by cloning the GitHub repository at bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD. Configure your API keys and set up the required folder structure with dedicated directories for planning documents, story files, source code, and test suites.

### Planning Phase Execution

Launch the planning phase in your web browser using Claude, ChatGPT, or another large-context model. Start with the Analyst Agent by providing your project idea and allowing it to conduct discovery through targeted questions about goals, constraints, and success metrics. Save the generated project-brief.md and pass it to the Product Manager Agent, which will create a comprehensive PRD with all functional and non-functional requirements clearly defined.

With the PRD complete, engage the Architect Agent to design your technical solution, ensuring it addresses all requirements while maintaining scalability and maintainability. The architect should produce detailed technical specifications including component diagrams, API contracts, and database schemas. If your project includes user interfaces, deploy the UX Expert Agent to create wireframes, user flows, and design system specifications that align with both user needs and technical constraints.

### Development Phase Orchestration

Transition to your IDE environment and begin the development phase by having the Product Owner Agent shard your planning documents into manageable story files. Each story should represent 1-3 story points of work with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies. The Scrum Master Agent then prepares the first story, adding implementation details, specific file paths, and granular task breakdowns that guide the Developer Agent's work.

Execute development cycles sequentially, with the Developer Agent implementing one story at a time. Ensure each implementation includes proper error handling, unit tests, inline documentation for complex logic, and adherence to established coding standards. After completing each story, commit all changes to version control before proceeding to maintain a clean, traceable development history.

The QA Agent reviews each completed story using multiple validation techniques. Risk assessment identifies potential issues before they reach production, while test design ensures comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. Requirements tracing verifies that implementations match specifications, and automated checks validate coding standards, security practices, and performance benchmarks.

### Quality Assurance and Deployment

Implement quality gates at each stage with mandatory checks including code review by the QA agent, all tests passing with minimum 80% coverage, performance benchmarks met, security scans clear, and documentation updated. The QA Agent generates detailed reports categorizing issues by severity (Blocker/Major/Minor) and provides specific suggestions for improvements. Only stories marked "Approved for Merge" proceed to deployment.

Deploy using your standard CI/CD pipeline, with BMAD-generated artifacts providing comprehensive documentation for deployment procedures. Monitor production performance using established metrics including error rates, response times, and user satisfaction scores. Use this feedback to inform future development cycles and continuously refine your BMAD implementation.

## Claude Code and AI agent integration strategies

Claude Code excels at BMAD integration through its terminal-based architecture that supports specialized subagents for different development tasks. The platform uses an orchestrator-worker pattern where a lead agent coordinates specialized subagents for security analysis, code review, and documentation generation. This architecture enables both sequential and parallel execution patterns, with agents maintaining shared context through file system artifacts and conversation history.

Integration follows the Plan-Execute-Reflect pattern where Claude Code generates execution plans, implements them across multiple files, and reflects on results for continuous improvement. Custom subagents can be created for specific domains like frontend, backend, testing, or security, each maintaining deep understanding of their specialized area while coordinating through the lead orchestrator.

Other AI coding platforms offer varying levels of multi-agent support. GitHub Copilot's agent mode provides context-aware editing across multiple files but primarily uses sequential workflows with limited parallelization. Cursor focuses on interactive development with strong human-in-the-loop validation, excelling at maintaining context within the IDE but lacking the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration of Claude Code. Platforms like CrewAI and AutoGen provide more advanced multi-agent capabilities, with CrewAI supporting role-based agents that mirror human teams and AutoGen enabling group chat orchestration for collaborative problem-solving.

## Breaking down projects for parallel multi-agent workflows

Effective task decomposition follows hierarchical patterns where huge tasks split into 15-25 subtasks, large tasks into 8-15, medium tasks into 3-8, and small tasks proceed to direct implementation. This granularity ensures each agent receives appropriately scoped work that can be completed efficiently without context overflow. Domain-based decomposition separates concerns along natural boundaries: frontend versus backend, feature-based divisions like authentication and data processing, layer-based separation of database, business logic, and presentation, and cross-cutting concerns including security, testing, and documentation.

Parallel execution succeeds best with embarrassingly parallel tasks that have minimal dependencies. Code generation for independent modules, test case creation for different components, documentation generation for separate features, and static analysis across different files can all proceed simultaneously without coordination overhead. Critical path optimization identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks and parallelizes everything else, using asynchronous task graphs for dynamic adaptation and implementing load balancing across available agents.

Multi-agent coordination requires sophisticated orchestration patterns. Sequential orchestration works well when agents must refine work step-by-step, with each building on previous outputs - ideal for workflows requiring cumulative context. Concurrent orchestration enables multiple agents to work in parallel and merge results, reducing execution time by up to 90% for independent subtasks. Group chat patterns allow agents to debate and validate outputs together, with maker-checker dynamics ensuring quality through iterative improvement.

Memory architecture supports coordination through three tiers: primary working memory for current tasks, secondary session memory for conversation history, and tertiary long-term memory for persistent knowledge. Shared memory stores using vector databases enable semantic similarity search, while privacy controls ensure agents only access appropriate information. Context optimization through compression, trimming, and semantic indexing maintains efficiency even as project complexity grows.

## Alternative methodologies for agentic coding

Test-Driven Development adapts uniquely for AI agents, focusing on behavioral evaluation rather than exact output matching. The AI TDD process maintains the classic red-green-refactor cycle but emphasizes scoring systems over binary pass/fail, enabling continuous adjustment based on real-world feedback. This approach provides clear, measurable goals for AI agents while reducing iteration time through rapid feedback loops. Test-Driven Generation represents an evolution where developers act as specifiers outlining requirements while AI generates both tests and implementation code.

Agile methodologies adapt to AI development through shorter sprints that match AI context windows, with continuous integration becoming even more critical when multiple agents contribute code simultaneously. Kanban boards visualize agent workloads and dependencies, while daily standups might become hourly sync points for rapidly evolving AI-driven projects. The key adaptation involves treating AI agents as team members with specific capacity constraints and specializations rather than unlimited resources.

Domain-Driven Design provides natural boundaries for agent specialization, with each bounded context potentially managed by a dedicated agent that maintains deep domain knowledge. This alignment between architectural patterns and agent responsibilities creates more maintainable systems where changes remain localized and agent expertise develops over time. Event-driven architectures complement multi-agent systems particularly well, with agents responding to domain events and maintaining eventual consistency across the system.

## Conductor and orchestration frameworks

Orkes Conductor leads enterprise orchestration with drag-and-drop AI operations including embeddings generation, chat completions, and vector database integration. The platform's AI Prompt Studio enables prompt template refinement and governance, while visual workflow editors create complex agentic workflows without code. Available AI tasks include LLM text generation, document indexing, semantic search, and dynamic forking for AI-driven decision trees. These capabilities enable RAG systems, chatbot development, and sophisticated classification workflows.

DRUID Conductor unifies multiple AI agents regardless of origin system, providing intelligent routing to specialized child bots for HR, IT, finance, and other domains. The platform supports on-the-fly agent creation through conversational interfaces, with real-time analytics tracking performance across the entire agent ecosystem. Seamless integration with CRM, ERP, and RPA systems enables enterprise-wide automation while maintaining governance and compliance requirements.

IBM watsonx Orchestrate brings enterprise-grade security to multi-agent orchestration, chaining AI decisions with business rules while maintaining comprehensive audit trails. The platform integrates both cloud and on-premises systems, enabling real-time collaboration between custom, pre-built, and third-party agents. This enterprise focus makes it particularly suitable for regulated industries requiring detailed logging and compliance tracking.

Supporting frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph provide developer-focused orchestration capabilities. LangChain excels at chaining LLM-driven tasks with tool augmentation, while LangGraph offers visual graph-based workflow management for complex AI logic flows. AutoGen from Microsoft enables open-source multi-agent collaboration with sophisticated conversation patterns, and CrewAI specializes in role-specific agent assignment that mirrors human team structures.

## Git worktrees enabling parallel development

Git worktrees revolutionize AI coding workflows by eliminating context switching overhead that typically costs 10-15 minutes per branch change. Each worktree provides an isolated environment where AI agents maintain deep understanding of specific codebase patterns without interference from other development streams. This isolation prevents agents from conflicting while enabling true parallel execution across multiple features simultaneously.

Implementation follows straightforward patterns using commands like `git worktree add ../project-feature-1 -b feature-1` to create isolated directories for each development stream. Supporting tools enhance this capability significantly. Crystal provides a desktop application for managing multiple Claude Code sessions with visual tracking, session persistence, and built-in git operations including rebase and squash functionality. The gwq tool offers global worktree management across repositories with fuzzy finding, task queue systems for automated development, and tmux session management for long-running processes.

Advanced implementations integrate custom Claude Code commands for orchestrating parallel workflows. Initialization commands create multiple worktrees automatically based on story decomposition, execution commands distribute tasks across agents with proper load balancing, and comparison commands evaluate results from different approaches to select optimal implementations. This sophisticated orchestration transforms worktrees from a simple git feature into a powerful parallel development platform.

The benefits compound when combined with BMAD's story-based development. Each worktree can host a dedicated agent working on a specific story, with complete context preservation and no interference between parallel streams. Merging completed work becomes straightforward since each worktree maintains clean commit history aligned with story boundaries.

## Story generation and comprehensive task breakdown

Effective story generation begins with proper epic decomposition, breaking large features into coherent groups of related functionality. Each epic should represent a deployable increment of value, typically requiring 2-4 weeks of development effort when fully implemented. Stories within epics follow the INVEST criteria: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable, with each story completable within 1-3 days by a single developer agent.

Story files in BMAD contain comprehensive context including PRD references, relevant architecture sections, explicit dependencies, and detailed acceptance criteria. Implementation details specify technical approaches, code patterns to follow, and testing requirements. The definition of done clearly states completion criteria including code implementation, test coverage, documentation updates, and QA approval. This self-contained structure ensures agents have everything needed without requiring additional context lookups.

Task breakdown within stories follows granular decomposition where no single task exceeds one developer-day of effort. Tasks sequence logically with clear dependencies identified, enabling parallel execution where possible. Each task includes specific deliverables, validation criteria, and integration points with other components. This granularity prevents agent context overflow while maintaining development momentum through continuous small victories.

The Scrum Master agent automates much of this breakdown process, analyzing epics to identify natural story boundaries and generating detailed task lists with appropriate sequencing. This automation ensures consistent quality in story preparation while freeing human developers to focus on strategic decisions and complex problem-solving.

## QA agent implementation and automated review excellence

Modern QA agents like Qodo (formerly Codium) employ multi-agent systems with specialized functions. The Gen Agent handles code generation and automated test authoring, while the Cover Agent improves test coverage through behavior analysis. The Merge Agent provides PR summaries, risk assessment, and automated code review with RAG-based context maintaining codebase awareness for intelligent suggestions. This comprehensive approach achieves **89% faster PR cycles** through intelligent automation.

Academic research demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-agent QA frameworks. CodeAgent simulates collaborative review teams with specialized Reviewer Agents performing vulnerability and consistency analysis, Coder Agents implementing revisions based on feedback, and QA-Checker supervisory agents preventing prompt drift in long conversations. High-level CTO/CEO agents provide strategic decision-making and final approval, mirroring real organizational structures.

Enterprise platforms like Bito AI Code Review Agent deliver senior engineer-level insights through contextual awareness and built-in static analysis tools. Line-level suggestions with one-click acceptance streamline the review process, while comprehensive metrics track PRs reviewed, issues found, and time saved. Security scanning ensures OWASP compliance and vulnerability detection, while style enforcement maintains consistent coding standards across the entire codebase.

The BMAD QA Agent (Quinn) functions as a Test Architect with deep expertise in test strategy, quality gates, and risk-based testing. Risk assessment commands evaluate stories before development begins, identifying potential bottlenecks with risks scored on a scale where scores ≥9 trigger automatic failures. Test design creates comprehensive strategies ensuring proper coverage, while requirements tracing verifies all specifications are adequately tested. Non-functional requirement validation checks performance, security, and scalability characteristics against defined thresholds.
