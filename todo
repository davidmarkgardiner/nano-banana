idea is to have chat bot on webpage
1. it can look at code/ knowledge base from gh repo and answer questions about app
2. it can report bugs/ imporvements/ feedback 

the chat from webpage will be sent to webhook in n8n
this will answer the user with info or ask user for further information if needed

if its general questions ai should consult knowledge base and if it cant find it then search the web.
once info given to user knowlegge base should be updated

from here if its bugs/ imporvements/ feedback this should be captured in github ticket and asssigned to @codex or @claude using the @tag

@codex = improvements or bugs
@claude = feedback

cluade will create the n8n workflow
codex will create the ui integration.

the workflow will be chat with user via chat bot > repsond > if needed cerate ticket > assignt to ai agent > they will cerate pr > pr will be reviewd sing github action (already in place) > playright test will be run on https website > when both playright and pr review pass tests, the pr be approved > code will be merged to mian branch

curl -X POST https://n8n.srv1021063.hstgr.cloud/webhook-test/chatbot \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message": "How do I setup the project?", "userId": "test-user"}'

  curl -X POST https://n8n.srv1021063.hstgr.cloud/webhook-test/bug-report \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message": "This button could be bigger", "userId": "test-user"}'
